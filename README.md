# Add to Cart Task Using Modal

This is a ReactJS web application that fetches product data from the Fake Store API and allows users to add products to a cart through a modal interface. The application is built with a focus on responsive design and clean, readable code.

## Task Description

The application performs the following functions:

- Fetches a list of products from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
- Displays products in a user-friendly format, including an image, title, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- Allows users to add products to a cart. If the product is already added, an alert message will display: **“Item already added to the cart”**.
- Shows the number of products in the cart on the Navbar.
- Opens a modal to display the cart's contents when the "Cart" button is clicked.
- Provides a "Remove from Cart" option in the modal to allow users to remove products from the cart.
- Passes necessary data between components using props.
- Updates the cart value correctly when products are added or removed.
- Ensures responsive design, working well on both desktop and mobile devices.
